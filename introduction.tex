In the last years/decades the possibilities to discuss news articles changed a lot. One of the biggest changes is that nowadays readers are able to share their opinion about a published article directly e.g. in a comment section. Despite the positive aspects it is also often misused. In consequence comment sections of online newspapers often get moderated, which binds additional resources and is cost intensive. Therefore it could be very helpful to know which of the published articles will get a large amount of comments in order to schedule publication times and plan moderator team sizes.

We decided on the task of identifying the weekly top $10\%$ articles with the highest comment volume as also described by Ambroselli et al. \cite{ambroselli2018prediction}. They present an approach using random forests.

In this paper we study if a deep learning approach can outperform their model on a similar dataset. We considered several different models and features.
Our contributions are (a) an analysis of the influence of different article features on the prediction performance, (b) the evaluation of different model architectures and (c) a comparison of our results against baselines presented by Ambroselli at al. \cite{ambroselli2018prediction}.
