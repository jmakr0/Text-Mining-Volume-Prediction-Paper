In this paper, we studied the task of predicting the weekly top 10\% commented articles from the British newspaper \textit{The Guardian}. We tested different deep learning models in combination with different input features.

We reached our best results using a combination of a convolution layer for the embedded headlines, a LSTM layer for the embedded first words of the article and a FC layer for the category.

Using our approach on a different dataset we outperformed the baseline approach from Tsagkias et al. \cite{tsagkias2009predicting} by 37\% and achieved a 24\% smaller $F_1$ for our prediction.
