In this paper, we studied the task of predicting the weekly top 10\% commented articles from the British newspaper \textit{The Guardian}. We tested different deep learning models in combination with different input features.

We reached our best results using a combination of a convolution layer for the embedded headlines, a LSTM layer for the embedded first words of the article and a FC layer for the category.

Using our approach on a different dataset we outperformed the baseline approach from Tsagkias et al. by $37\%$ and achieved a $8\%$ smaller $F_1$ as Ambroselli et al. for our prediction.
