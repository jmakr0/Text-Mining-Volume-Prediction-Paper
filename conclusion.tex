In this paper, we studied the task of predicting the weekly top $10\%$ commented on articles from the British newspaper \textit{The Guardian}. We tested different deep learning models in combination with different input features and introduced a metric how competitive articles are to each other.

We reached our best results using a combination of a convolution layer for the embedded headline, an LSTM layer for the embedded first $50$ words of the article, and an FC layer for the category.

Using our approach on a different dataset, we outperformed the baseline approach from Tsagkias et al. by $42\%$, and achieved an $5\%$ smaller $F_1$ as Ambroselli et al. for our prediction.
