In this study, we attempted to predict the weekly top $10\%$ commented on articles from the British newspaper \textit{The Guardian}. 
We tested different deep learning models in combination with different input features and introduced a metric describing competitiveness between articles.

Using a combination of a convolution layer for the embedded headline, an LSTM layer for the embedded first $50$ words of the article, and an FC layer for the category gave us our most promising results.

Using this approach on a different dataset, we outperformed the baseline approach from Tsagkias et al.\ by $42\%$, and achieved a $5\%$ lower $F_1$ as Ambroselli et al.\ for our prediction.
